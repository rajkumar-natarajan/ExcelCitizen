## 🔄 Release Workflow — Build 3 (April 30, 2026)

This section documents the end-to-end steps taken to release build 3 to TestFlight.

### 1. Code Changes

**Bug fix:** On the Dashboard screen, category practice sessions were always presenting the correct answer as the first option (option A), because the questions were fetched via `getQuestionsByType()` which bypasses the shuffle pipeline.

**Fix applied in** `lib/screens/dashboard_screen.dart`:
- Added `import 'dart:math';`
- Changed `List<Question>.from(questions)..shuffle()` to use a seeded `Random()` instance
- Applied `withShuffledOptions(random)` to each selected question so option order is randomised on every session

```dart
// Before
final shuffled = List<Question>.from(questions)..shuffle();
final selectedQuestions = shuffled.take(10).toList();

// After
final random = Random();
final shuffled = List<Question>.from(questions)..shuffle(random);
final selectedQuestions = shuffled.take(10).map((q) => q.withShuffledOptions(random)).toList();
```

### 2. Git — Commit & Push

```bash
cd /Users/rajkumarnatarajan/Documents/raj/excel_citizen_flutter

git add lib/screens/dashboard_screen.dart
git commit -m "fix: shuffle answer options dynamically in category practice"
git push origin main
```

### 3. Bump Build Number

Updated `pubspec.yaml`:
```yaml
# Before
version: 1.0.0+2

# After
version: 1.0.0+3
```

### 4. Build iOS Release Archive

```bash
flutter build ipa --release
```

Successful output:
```
✓ Built build/ios/archive/Runner.xcarchive (153.4MB)

[✓] App Settings Validation
    • Version Number: 1.0.0
    • Build Number: 3
    • Display Name: ExcelCitizen
    • Deployment Target: 13.0
    • Bundle Identifier: com.curiousdev.excelCitizenFlutter
```

> **Note:** `flutter build ipa --release` builds the `.xcarchive` but may fail at the IPA export step if automatic provisioning cannot resolve the certificate. Use `xcodebuild -exportArchive` directly in that case (step 5).

### 5. Export IPA & Upload to App Store Connect

```bash
xcodebuild -exportArchive \
  -archivePath /Users/rajkumarnatarajan/Documents/raj/excel_citizen_flutter/build/ios/archive/Runner.xcarchive \
  -exportPath /Users/rajkumarnatarajan/Documents/raj/excel_citizen_flutter/build/ios/ipa \
  -exportOptionsPlist /Users/rajkumarnatarajan/Documents/raj/excel_citizen_flutter/ios/ExportOptions.plist \
  -allowProvisioningUpdates
```

The `-allowProvisioningUpdates` flag allows Xcode to automatically fetch and update provisioning profiles during export without needing manual Keychain interaction.

Successful output:
```
Progress 83%: Upload succeeded.
Uploaded Runner
** EXPORT SUCCEEDED **
```

The IPA is exported to `build/ios/ipa/excel_citizen_flutter.ipa` and simultaneously uploaded directly to App Store Connect.

### 6. Commit & Push Version Bump

```bash
git add pubspec.yaml
git commit -m "chore: bump build number to 3 for TestFlight"
git push origin main
```

### 7. Verify on App Store Connect

1. Open [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com)
2. Navigate to **My Apps → ExcelCitizen → TestFlight**
3. Build 3 appears under "iOS Builds" with status **"Processing"** initially, then **"Ready to Test"**
4. Add/notify internal testers or submit for external Beta App Review

### Quick Reference — Full Release Commands

```bash
cd /path/to/excel_citizen_flutter

# 1. Make changes, commit and push
git add <files>
git commit -m "your message"
git push origin main

# 2. Bump build number in pubspec.yaml (version: x.y.z+N)

# 3. Build the archive

# 4. Export & upload to App Store Connect
